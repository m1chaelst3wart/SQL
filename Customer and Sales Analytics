#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#Q1: How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) as Total_Orders FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#Q2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) as Total_Orders FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product='iPhone';

#Q3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE order_id<>''
AND order_id<>'Order ID';

#Q4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#Q5: What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product
, ROUND(SUM(quantity)*price,2) as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product<>''
GROUP BY product;

#Q6: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT

, product
, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#Q7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
count(distinct cust.acctnum)
, ROUND(avg(quantity*price),2)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
